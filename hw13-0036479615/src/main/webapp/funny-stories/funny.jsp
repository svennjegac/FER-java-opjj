<h1>Police officer</h1>

<p>An honest man was being tailgated by a stressed out woman on a
	busy boulevard. Suddenly, the light turned yellow, just in front of
	him. He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he
	could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the
	intersection. The tailgating woman hit the roof, and the horn,
	screaming in frustration as she missed her chance to get through the
	intersection. As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her
	window and looked up into the face of a very serious police officer.
	The officer ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. He took her
	to the police station where she was searched, finger printed,
	photographed, and placed in a holding cell. After a couple of hours, a
	policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted
	back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with
	her personal effects. He said, "I'm very sorry for this mistake. You
	see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn,
	flipping off the guy in front of you, and cussing a blue streak at him.
	"I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would
	Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday-School' bumper
	sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk.
	Naturally, I assumed you had stolen the car."</p>
