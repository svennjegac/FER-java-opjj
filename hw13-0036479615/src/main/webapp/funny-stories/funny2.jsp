<h1>Deaf wife</h1>

<p>A man feared his wife wasn't hearing as well as she used to and
	he thought she might need a hearing aid. Not quite sure how to approach
	her, he called the family doctor to discuss the problem. The Doctor
	told him there is a simple informal test the husband could perform to
	give the doctor a better idea about her hearing loss. Here's what you
	do," said the Doctor, "stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a
	normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to
	30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response." That
	evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the
	den. He says to himself, "I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what
	happens." Then in a normal tone he asks, 'Honey, what's for dinner?" No
	response. So, the husband moves closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet
	from his wife and repeats, "Honey, what's for dinner?" Still no
	response. Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet
	from his wife and asks, "Honey, what's for dinner?" Again he gets no
	response. So, he walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away.
	"Honey, what's for dinner?" Again, there is no response. So, he walks
	right up behind her. "Honey, what's for dinner?" "Clyde, for the fifth
	time... CHICKEN!"</p>
